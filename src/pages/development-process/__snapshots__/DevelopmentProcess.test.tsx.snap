          <p>
            As first, I have created a new project with CreateReactApp script. It generates the boilerplate codes and removes the need for manual configuration of everything.
            <br />
            Because I wanted to have control over the entire project, I used \`reject\` command to ask CreateReactApp script to publish all of the configuration files that it hides on default.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Decision about the UI library
          </h2>
          <p>
            Based on the requirements of the project which was a website with header, sidebar, and footer, I decided to pick this template.
            <br />
            <a
              href="https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/dashboard/"
            >
              https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/dashboard/
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            So, I added the the template files to project and I was able to run this template inside my react app.
          </p>
          <p>
            From, this point the actual word started. Since, I wanted to make sure that I have tests from the early phase of the project and I'm checking the coverage report constantly, I added the coverage report to my package.json.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the next step, I changed the sidebar component to have three main pages.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Search
            </li>
            <li>
              Development Process
            </li>
            <li>
              About
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <b>
              Search
            </b>
             page will be the main page that I will implement based on the project description.
            <br />
            I will use 
            <b>
              Development Process
            </b>
             page to describe the steps that I took during the project to do it.
            <br />
            And the 
            <b>
              About
            </b>
             page will be a short info page about me.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Implement Routing for the Project
          </h2>
          <p>
            After that, I wanted to be able to have the navigation between sidebar and the actual pages. So, I used 
            <b>
              React Router Dom
            </b>
             to implement routing. I added links and routes to the project.
            <br />
            Also, I refactored the template files in order to have one 
            <b>
              Page Layout
            </b>
             which consists header, sidebar, and footer and three components which render the actual content of the page based on the route.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
